        <div class="faq-answer">
        The NETworks project aims to improve existing network coverage maps by identifying discrepancies and issues that affect real-life mobile network connections. By engaging everyday users, we aim to analyze these maps more effectively. Our goal is to pinpoint areas needing network improvements and ensure that coverage maps align better with actual user experiences. Ultimately, we aim to identify regions that require enhanced network quality.

            <h3>
                <span class="text-padding">How is the mobile connection tied to the network speed?</span>
            </h3>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">The mobile connection speed determines how quickly data travels between your device and the network. Factors like network generation (2G, 3G, 4G, 5G), signal strength, network congestion, location, and device capability influence this speed, affecting how fast you can browse, stream, or download on your mobile device.</div>

            <h3>
                <span class="text-padding">Which external factors affect mobile network connection?</span>
            </h3>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            Several external factors can affect mobile network connections:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Physical Obstructions:</strong> Buildings, terrain, and natural features can block or weaken signals, causing signal loss or reduced quality.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Distance from Towers:</strong> Proximity to cell towers affects signal strength. Being too far might result in weaker signals and slower connections.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Weather Conditions:</strong> Extreme weather (rain, snow, storms) can interfere with signals, causing disruptions or slower speeds.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Network Congestion:</strong> High usage in an area can lead to congestion, slowing down data speeds during peak times.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Interference:</strong> Electronic devices, metal structures, or electromagnetic interference can disrupt signals.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Roaming:</strong> Using a different carrier's network can result in varying signal quality and connection speeds.
                </li>
            </ul>
            These external factors collectively influence the reliability, speed, and quality of your mobile network connection.

            </h3>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            There are a few reasons why this can happen.
            <ul>
                <li>If you did not track any data yet, there will also be no data displayed. Check the "total km tracked data" in the "Personal Data Analysis" tab.</li>
                <li>Make sure to always login in with the same user ID. Only then the data from all the login sessions will be displayed.</li>
                <li>The default settings will adjust the window to your current location. Zoom in and out in different regions on the map. Your trajectories might not be visible in the current window but appear when changing it.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>
                <span class="text-padding">What is so special about trains considering mobile network connections?</span>
            </h3>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Signal repeaters on trains amplify and distribute mobile signals within carriages, improving connectivity for passengers. They capture signals from cell towers, reducing disruptions caused by speed, tunnels, or remote areas. These repeaters alleviate congestion, enhancing connections and data speeds. Despite their benefits, their effectiveness depends on initial signal quality, repeater design, and geographical challenges.</p>
            <p>For the NETworks project train amplifiers falsify the information about the mobile connection around train tracks. Therefore tracked data along train tracks is filtered and not taken into account when analysing the data.</p>

            </h3>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>When you track data, the length of the tracked trip is calculated. The longer your trip, the greater the benefit to our project. The length of all your trips with the same user ID is added and for every 10km you get 0.1 CHF discount on your current payment of mobile plan. The total discount is displayed in the "personal data analysis" tab. Every month the discount and the total km tracked will be reset.</p>
            <p>Your discount code will only work if you have a monthly mobile subscription with one of the three Swiss network providers: Salt, Sunrise or Swisscom. Each discount code is for single use only. Go to your network provider's website to enter the code.</p>
